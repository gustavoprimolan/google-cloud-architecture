<h1>Introducting Google Cloud Platform</h1>

<h2>Welcome to GCP Fundamentals</h2>

* GCP offers 4 main kinds of services:
    * Compute
    * Storage
    * Big Data
    * Machine Learning

* Infrastructure focus on compute

<h2>What is cloud computing?</h2>

* Cloud computing is a way of using I.T that has these five equally important traits.
    * First, you get computing resources on demand and self-service. All you have to do is use a simple interface and you get the processing power, storage, and network you need.
    * Second, you access these resources over the net from anywhere you want.
    * Third, the provider of those resources has a big pool of them and allocates them to customers out that pool. Customer don't have to know or care about the exactly physical location of those resources.
    * Fouth, the resources are elastic. If you need more resources you can get more, rapidly. If you need less you can scale back.
    * Five, the customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go.

<h2>How did we get here?</h2>

* Colocation was the first wave of the trend that brought us towards cloud computing.
* Insted of building costly capital intensive data center, they can rent space in shared facilities.

* The component of a virtualized data center match the parts of a physical data center

* About 10 years ago, Google realized that its business couldn't move fast enough within the confines of the virtualization model. Google switch to container.

<h2>Every company is a data company</h2>

* Google Cloud provides a wide variety of services for managing and getting value from data and doing that at scale.

<h2>Quiz</h2>

*  Cloud computing resources are available on-demand and self-service. (An exception: cloud computing providers typically set some limits on the amount of resources a customer can consume by default, to help customers avoid accidental runaway resource usage and charges. These limits can be raised by the cloud provider.)

* The cloud provider has a pool of resources and lets you use more or less on demand.
